    "The following code runs a simulation which sweeps acoss masses of armatures (projectiles) ranging from $10^9$ kg (about the mass of the heaviest crane vessel) to $10^{24}$ kg (roughly one fifth the mass of the earth). The point of this is to find the minimum voltage that must be supplied to the railgun, per every sweeped mass value, to get the Earth into escape velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass sweep starts at $10^9$ kg because at every mass smaller than that, the voltage goes higher than what can be simulated feasibly. This is because at voltages higher than approximately $10^{20}$ V, the projectile launches of the railgun (of length $10$ km) in less than $10^{-15}$ seconds. Thus, to be able to accurately capture the event, the simulation step size must be smaller than $10^{-17}$ s, which slows downs simulations incredibly. This also makes actual optimization operations (which involve multiple simulations) nearly impossible to conduct - one such attempt took more than a day to complete."
