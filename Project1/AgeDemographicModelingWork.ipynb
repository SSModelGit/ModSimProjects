Each bucket has an associated birth and death rate as well (the birth rate only applies to newborn, while the death rate applies to all buckets, at varying values) - the addition of birth and death rates will be handled in the next section. The collection of buckets will comprise the main state of the simulation, the age demographic based population count.\n",
